      My body of work explores the confluence of humanity, nature, and technology by telling mythic stories that play with rules and systems to discover the truths and lies of this ever-changing world. I am an interdisciplinary artist that uses dynamic language to dismantle binaries and blur boundaries in favor of a more nuanced understanding of reality and unrealities.

      My works take life as online interactive texts that immerse the reader in my constructed worlds, in hallucinatory audio pieces, and on the page as poetry and stories. Participation is crucial to me; I invite my audience to play with my work to inspire meaningful thought of their own. My work often has minimal visual components, like text, but none of my work is made for the eyes. My eye is fickle and my gaze fleeting, so I find visuals make no impression on me other than to overstimulate. My ears, however, are responsive. I delight in all sounds, whether within poetry or my field recordings. I am inspired by scientists, philosophers, journalists and their processes. I interrogate the familiar to uncover the strange and investigate the unknown to find familiarity. I make nonsense of sense and sense of nonsense.

      HOW WERE YOU BORN?? is a poem and game that invites the viewer to participate in telling the legend of their birth. Of course, there are a finite number of prewritten possibilities that might or might not interest the participant, but they must choose. Once a path is begun, the player is unable to return to the first page, mirroring the perceived importance of birth state to identity. At the end of every path the player is asked how they were born and they may respond that they were born or they were not. Either way, they are congratulated on this birth or nonbirth.

      Currently, I am hosting a radio show called Radiesthesia as Your Oracle in which I experiment with machine learning programs, homemade algorithms, and other methods of generating texts. I read the texts aloud as sound poetry and attempt to divine meaning from the assemblage of words while my co host, Your Conduit, improvises the showâ€™s score on an analog synthesizer.
